# CC3 Blender Tools
An add-on for importing and automatically setting up materials for Character Creator 3 character exports.

Using Blender in the Character Creator 3 pipeline can often feel like hitting a brick wall. Spending potentially hours having to get the import settings correct and setting up the materials often with hundreds of textures.

This add-on aims to reduce that time spent getting characters into Blender down to just a few seconds and make use of as many of the exported textures as possible so that character artists can work in the highest quality possible using Blender.
