# TODO

- ShapeKey Actions:
    - ShapeKey retargeting from one character on an armature to the current rigified character
    - Facial expression extraction from shapekey actions (for NLA).
- Export Rigify > Unity
    - Optional export Just animation to Unity, (just those meshes with shapekey tracks?).
    - Options to export just NLA or loose actions.
    - Optional export full face rig/just eyes and jaw
    - Optional export/bake(NLA) shapekey actions.
- Meta Rig
