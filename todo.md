# TODO
- Popup panels
- Prefs for physics settings.
- Button to auto transfer skin weights to accessories.
- limits on node group inputs in _LIB.

# FUTURE PLANS
- Get all search strings to identify material type: skin, eyelashes, body, hair etc... from preferences the user can customise. (Might help with Daz conversions and/or 3rd party characters that have non-standard or unexpected material names.)
- Automatically generate full IK rig with Rigify or Auto-Rig Pro (Optional in the preferences) (Not sure if this is possible to invoke these add-ons from code...)
